It was always one of my passions to become a create different  advertising campaigns  of television commercials and for that reason, I decided to continue to learn the path of publicity. I was presented the opportunity to practice Photoshop in particular class in my country. But in Miami, I  hopes of a better future for myself. When I  put this class, I think  my Photoshop level is going to be better, I endured the process of obtaining finish my major , which was one of my greatest accomplishments. This would open the doors to this country and allow me to study and finish my career. It is for this reason that I desire to be enrolled in the Miami International University of Arts and Designs, since I am completely sure that this university is one of the best when it comes to a career in the arts.and the best professors. For me is the best universities in Florida. It also prepares the students not only on an educational level but also professionally.

I know for a fact that the image manipulation class, will challenge me and prepare me in every single aspect of my professional career and journey. I am also very aware that there are many alternative careers in the field of publicity and I am sure that in my scholastic journey I could develop a passion for another Photoshop area and be able to work with different  programs , as well as working for the best publicity agencies in the country. This can only be accomplished if I continue my journey full of positive projects within the university. It is also important to state that I want to give the best that I have, by participating in different activities that the class  provides and thus saturating my life with as many opportunities provided to learn what it is like to be a professional publicist. One of the things that grabs my attention the most about this university is the fact that all of the students leave with extremely high levels of knowledge of all of the programs of softwareâ€™s. I would hope that I would also be able to obtain that level of mastery through the different classes provided by the university, considering the fact that our technology continues to advance and this class seems to keep up to date with these advancements.
